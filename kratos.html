        <p class="p1">The video games industry boats numerous sagas, ranging from poignant tales of personal triumph to stories of betrayal, and even some of widespread devastation and death. However, there is one that combines it all: the thrill of confronting each of your enemies, defeating them, and continuing the adventure, all while witnessing the character’s transformation from a vengeful and furious god to one filled with peace and mercy. This is <span><i>“God Of War”</i></span>. </p>
        
        <p class="p2">Anyone immersed in the world of gaming knows this important saga for the industry. This saga consists of 8 games that make up its story:</p>
        
        <div class="p3">
          <p><span>GOW Games:</span></p>
          <p><span>1.</span> God Of War.</p>
          <p><span>2.</span> God Of War II.</p>
          <p><span>3.</span> God Of War III.</p>
          <p><span>4.</span> God Of War: Ascencion.</p>
    <p><span>5.</span> God Of War: Chains Of Olympus.</p>
    <p><span>6.</span> God Of War: Ghost Of Sparta.</p>
    <p><span>7.</span> God Of War (2018).</p>
    <p><span>8.</span> God Of War Ragnarök.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p class="p4">However, this game can be enjoyed in two ways: in release order or in chronological order, since this, like other games, follows a story that does not go hand in hand with the release order of each game but with the story behind each of them and how they are connected to one or the other. So if you want to enjoy this game in chronological order, here's the correct order:</p>
  
  <div class="p5">
    <p><span>1.</span> God Of War: Ascencion.</p>
    <p><span>2.</span> God Of War: Chains Of Olympus.</p>
    <p><span>3.</span> God Of War.</p>
    <p><span>4.</span> God Of War: Ghost Of Sparta.</p>
    <p><span>5.</span> God Of War II.</p>
    <p><span>6.</span> God Of War III.</p>
    <p><span>7.</span> God Of War (2018).</p>
    <p><span>8.</span> God Of War Ragnarök.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p class="p6">The story of GOW isn't really difficult to understand, yet it's very profound, going beyond just a Spartan enraged and resentful towards the gods. It's a story of redemption, blood as a form of payment, revenge, and the fight against inhuman acts that haunt you from your dark past.</p>

  <p class="p7">Why do I love this saga so much? It's not an easy question to answer, since I only started thinking about it a few days ago and I still haven't found a clear answer. Maybe it's the excitement and feeling I had when I played it for the first time, how the story captivated me and left me wanting more, seeing how I grew stronger over time, how each puzzle became more complex and each new opponent had a different strategy, the bosses, the minigames, and the adventure you experience in each installment.</p>
  
  <p class="p8">Honestly, it's satisfying to take down hordes of enemies, how you combine combos and make them all fall at once, and although it might sound a bit psychotic, the blood detail is what I love most about this series; it makes defeating enemies more realistic and satisfying. I know, it sounds strange to say, but oh well.</p>
  
  <p class="p9">Maybe that's why I love this series so much and enjoy it so much. If you haven't played any of these games yet, I encourage you to do so and enjoy one of the best video game series in the industry—in my opinion, the best.</p>
  
  <p class="p10">Thanks for reading this post. See you next time. Goodbye!</p>
